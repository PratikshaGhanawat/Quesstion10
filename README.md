Develop a web application in ASP.NET that utilizes different state
management techniques. Create a simple webpage with a form
containing user input fields. Implement the following state
management techniques and demonstrate their usage:
- View State:
a) Store a piece of information in the view state, such as a user's
input on the form.
b) Retrieve and display this information after a postback.
- Session State:
a) Store user-specific data in session state, like user preferences
or settings.
b) Implement a functionality to clear the session data after a
certain event or timeout
